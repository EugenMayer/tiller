# Getting help

For problems and improvements, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/markround/tiller/issues), or drop by the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/markround/tiller) to chat. These are the preferred options, as then others can see and benefit from any solutions. Alternatively, send me an email : github@markround.com and I'll do my best to help.
