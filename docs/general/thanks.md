# Thanks

Thanks to everyone who has submitted bug reports and feature requests. Also a special mention and huge thanks to JetBrains, for providing me with a free [opensource project license](https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/opensource/) for the fantastic [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) IDE!

And of course, the biggest thanks and love go to my wonderful wife for all her support and for putting up with my late-night brain "fizzing" when I'm pondering new features or thinking in Ruby :)
